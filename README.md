# My Collection of Small Games
## Pong
Welcome to my take of the classic PONG.

### Objective of PONG
The point of playing PONG is to see my take on the game and a different style and layout.


### Gameplay Instructions
Use the mouse to click around the menu buttons and select different functions and whatnot. Use the 'W' and 'S' keys to 
move player one up and down. Use the 'UP' and 'DOWN' keys to move player two.


### Scoring
Scoring in this game is determined through scoring on the opponent and ending up with either the most points, or by 
surviving.
